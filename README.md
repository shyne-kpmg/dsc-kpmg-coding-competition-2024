# Instructions

Complete the functions in the ***solutions*** folder to solve the tasks defined in ***tasks.pdf***.

You may use built-in python packages, NumPy, and Pandas. To use NumPy and Pandas, you will need to import the packages in your solution files.

**Note**: Alternative instructions are provided in ***intructions.ipynb*** if you would like to use an iPython notebook rather than the terminal.

## Getting Started

Open a terminal and run `py --version` and `python --version` to determine whether you can use `py`, `python`, or either to run python commands.

If you need to use `python`, you will have to begin the below commands with `python` rather than `py`.

**Optional**: To create and activate a virtual environment, run the below commands.

```bash
py -m venv myvenv
myvenv\Scripts\activate #Windows
source myvenv/bin/activate #Mac
```

To install pandas and numpy, run the below commands.

```bash
py -m pip install numpy
py -m pip install pandas
```

To rename all solution files to include your team name, run the below command, replacing *your_team_name* with your chosen team name.

```bash
py -m rename_solutions your_team_name
```

## Testing Solutions

You can run your solutions against sample test cases using the below code, replacing 0 with the solution number you would like to test.

```bash
py -m test_solution 0
```

**Note**: The test cases are defined in examples_local.py.
